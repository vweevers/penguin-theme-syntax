# penguin syntax theme for atom

**Playful and gentle syntax theme, a work in progress (mainly optimized for ES6, JSX, LESS/SASS) (also, I should really calibrate my monitor)**. Originally forked from Monokai Blackboard. Fits well (almost) with Isotope UI Theme (and custom background color `rgb(21,21,21)`).
